Text of the abstract. It should not be longer than 200 words. Describe concisely what the problem is that you want to solve, what approach/methods you used (but keep it at a high level, don't write what you called your functions etc), and what your results are. Keep it all one paragraph. The idea is that a reader should be able to understand in 2 minutes or less what you are doing, how you are doing it, and what you get. Finish with one sentence on conclusions or future work. Finally include a statement along the following lines: Code is available at <URL> [under <LICENSE>]. --- Licensing is  optional, see https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license which will send you to http://choosealicense.com/. REPLACE ALL THE TEXT IN THIS ABSTRACT WITH YOUR OWN TITLE, AUTHOR NAMES AND ABSTRACT. THEN COMMIT AND PUT "added abstract" IN THE COMMIT MESSAGE. THE ABSTRACT IS DUE 05/03/2016 11:59 PM AZ TIME.
