# Information on the Poster

Present your work at the *Computational Methods in Physics Poster
Session* on 05/05/2016 from 11:30am to 2pm in PSH 355.

* all team members need to attend
* individual Q&A at poster will be part of your grade

See [docs/final_poster.pdf](../docs/final_poster.pdf) for more
details.

Keep in mind that the whole point of a poster is that *you* stand in
front of it and *explain* it so it does not have stand on its own;
rather add everything that *you* need in order to explain your
science: More graphs and images and tables (data) and less text!

## Poster dimensions and material

* poster boards will be 30 in x 40 in (762 mm x 1016 mm), either
  portrait or landscape format
* posters may consist of individual printed pages attached to the
  board or a fully printed poster
* Individual pages will be attached with either tape or pins, printed
  posters can be attached with clamps. All mounting materials (poster
  boards, easels, pins, tape, clamps) will be available.

## Other demo materials

You may bring a laptop or other device to show additional animations
or produce sounds that are not easily communicated on static posters
but your poster must stand on its own without the additional demo
materials.

## Poster content

Each poster *must* include

* title
* names of authors
* GitHub URL of the code repository and information on the license
  under which the code is available (if authors choose a license)
* acknowledgements (if help was received from outside the team)

Recommended structure:

* background (can include outline of the problem, equations to be solved, ...)
* methods (can include algorithms, parameters, key code snippets, flow
  diagrams, diagrams of relationships between objects)
* results (focus on graphs and tables, i.e. show the data)
* conclusions/summary
* references (if any)
