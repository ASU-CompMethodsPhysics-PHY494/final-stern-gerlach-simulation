Greg Vetaw
-Helped start the semi-classical simulation.
	Made suggestions on how to make a randomized array between ±ℏ and helped with debugging the simulation.
- Started the quantum simulation by defining the Gaussian function and helped with debugging and interpreting the results.
- Created introduction and conclusion and wrote the theory and method for poster.
- wrote the abstract.

Nate Simon
- Core quantum simulation implementation with finite difference.
- Code refactor for classical simulation

Andrew Durkiewicz
- Wrote the core-code for the semi-classical simulation. 
- Responsible for writing the results section.
- Responsible for writing the Proposal.
- Final Printing
- Contributed in finding articles and sources that helped solve wave function in the 	quantum mechanical simulation.
