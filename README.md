# ASU PHY 494 Final Project #

For your **Final Project** you have to:

1. fulfill the **objectives** that you defined in your **Proposal**
   (add your `proposal.pdf` to the repository under `docs`);
2. collaborate as a team;
3. use the Wiki to keep a "lab notebook" for the project;
4. present the work as a poster;
5. individually explain various aspects of the work in a Q&A in front
   of the poster.

For an overview over the requirements see [docs/final_overview.pdf](docs/final_overview.pdf).

## Team repository
You will be working in your private repository to which only your team
has access. Your instructor will send you a link to automatically set
up this repository (services provided by
[Classroom for GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/)).

Your private team repository should be named **final-PROJECT-TITLE**.


### Updating the Team repository

In order to pull in changes and updates from the
[Final Project](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/Final_Project)
repository, run the [update.sh](scripts/update.sh) script:

```bash
./scripts/update.sh
```

## Directory layout

* `Submission`: Put all the *code* and *data* required to perform the required
  simulations in this directory. When grading, only code in this
  directory will be taken into account.
* `docs`: notes and other documentation (not graded).
* `poster`: put the **poster** (and supporting files as specified in
   the instructions) into a separate  directory.
* `Work`: additional code and data that you want to version control
  but that should not be graded.
* `Grade`: instructors/graders can add comments in this directory.
  

## Submission

* Submit **code and data** through your GitHub repository. Make sure that
  [GitHub properly associates your commits with your GitHub username](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/). Check
  that the *contributions* are properly accounted
  for (the **Contributors** statistics under **Graphs**).
* Commit your **abstract** as `poster/abstract.txt`
* Commit your **poster** to the GitHub repo, too, as `poster/poster.pdf` (convert to PDF).
